# aspiring-infosec
A centralized repository of InfoSec learning resources.

## Overview
Information Security (InfoSec) is a wildly exciting, and rapidly growing field.  There is no shortage of readily available resources that seek to enrich, inspire, and train budding InfoSec practitioners.  However, these resources come in many shapes and sizes - ranging from ~$6,000 USD courses (think SANS), to online platforms operating monthly or annualy subsription models, to completely free.  The options also vary by skill and quality.

## How is this repo organized?

In its infancy, the aspiring-infosec repo is no more than a single README file.  The following sections provide the following:

1.  A list of resources organized by price point/model
2.  A brief overview of each resource
